## Intent

IFC 4x3 RC2
This scenario has a simple alignment with left arc in horizontal and no vertical.

That is it has:
 Civil Horizontal Geometry (HG): straight, an arc with ifc positive radius of curvature, and a straight

In the ifc file there is only the ifc semantic definition of the alignment and no ifc geometry.
The Ifc file was generated by 12d Model. 

## Prerequisites

- none

## Content

This scenario covers the additional concepts and/or IFC entities:

- IfcAlignment                  - fudged Axis as there is no Ifc geometry
- IfcAlignmentHorizontal
- IfcAlignmentHorizontalSegment - PredefinedType LINE
- IfcAlignmentHorizontalSegment - PredefinedType CIRCULARARC for a left arc

## Supporting files

Following files correspond to this scenario:

| Filename                        | Description                                                                           |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `UT_Alignment-12d-1.ifc`        | the exported content as an IFC file                                                   |
| `UT_Alignment-12d-1.png`        | plan view of the alignment, and the horizontal segment parameters (with Civil radius) |
